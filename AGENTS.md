## Project Overview
EphemerAl is a privacy-focused document chat application. It runs as a Docker Compose
stack inside WSL2 (Ubuntu) on Windows. Three containers make up the stack: a Streamlit
frontend, an Ollama LLM backend, and an Apache Tika document parsing server.

## Architecture
- **Streamlit app** (`ephemeral_app.py`): The web frontend. Connects to Ollama and Tika
  via Docker service names over an internal Docker network. Environment variables configure
  the endpoints.
- **Ollama**: Serves the LLM inside a container with GPU passthrough. API on port 11434.
- **Apache Tika Server**: Parses documents inside a container. API on port 9998.
- **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.yml`): Defines the full stack. Containers communicate
  by Docker service name (`ollama`, `tika-server`) on a shared `llm-net` bridge network.

## Key Files
- `ephemeral_app.py` — Main application. All state is in-memory (session_state).
- `ephemeral/` — Mixed package: pure utility modules (`config`, `export`, `stream_filter`, `token_budget`) are import-safe with no Streamlit dependency, while client modules (`tika_client`, `llm_client`) are Streamlit-aware by design.
- `ephemeral/config.py` — Env parsing helpers and shared configuration constants.
- `ephemeral/export.py` — Conversation transcript/export builders (Markdown/HTML).
- `ephemeral/tika_client.py` — Tika health check and document parsing client helpers.
- `ephemeral/llm_client.py` — Ollama/OpenAI client helpers, model metadata probes, and token counting.
- `ephemeral/stream_filter.py` — Stateful think-block/thought-channel stream filter.
- `ephemeral/token_budget.py` — Token estimation helpers.
- `docker-compose.yml` — Stack definition. Pins Ollama and Tika image versions.
- `Dockerfile` — Builds the Streamlit app container image.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies (installed inside the app container).
- `requirements-dev.txt` — Development-only test dependencies (pytest/coverage).
- `tests/` — Pytest suite for import-safe utility modules.
- `System Deployment Guide.md` — End-user deployment instructions (target audience: IT
  generalists, not developers). Written for WSL2 + Docker on Windows 11.
- `README.md` — Project overview, feature list, system requirements.
- `system_prompt_template.md` — LLM system prompt template. The default template is
  model-agnostic and omits `<|think|>`.
- `.streamlit/config.toml` — Streamlit theme and config. The Dockerfile merges server
  settings into this file at build time.
- `theme.css` — Custom CSS loaded by the app.
- `.gitignore` — Git hygiene for local/dev artifacts (venvs, caches, editor files, secrets).
- `.dockerignore` — Docker build-context hygiene to keep non-runtime files out of images; must not exclude `.streamlit/config.toml`.
- `static/` — Logo and static assets.

## Conventions
- The deployment guide is written for non-technical IT staff. Use plain language,
  avoid jargon, explain every step, and provide copy-pasteable commands.
- The app runs inside Docker. Environment variable defaults in `ephemeral_app.py` MUST
  use Docker service names (`http://ollama:11434/v1` and `http://tika-server:9998`),
  NOT `localhost`. Using localhost as defaults will break the Docker Compose deployment.
- The default LLM model is `ephemeral-default` (`LLM_MODEL_NAME=ephemeral-default` in
  `docker-compose.yml`). The alias should be created from `qwen3.6:35b-a3b`.
- The app detects model capabilities (vision support, context size) at runtime via
  Ollama's `/api/show` endpoint, so it adapts to different models automatically.

## Runtime and Branding Targets
- Target runtime is Python 3.10+.
- Streamlit migration target is 1.56.0 for UI work.
- Repository/package names may remain `EphemerAl`, but user-facing UI copy should use
  **EphemerAI** unless a broader rename is explicitly requested.

## Streamlit 1.56 UI Guidance
- `st.set_page_config(initial_sidebar_state=304)` is valid in Streamlit 1.56 and should
  be used when a 304px default sidebar is needed while preserving auto behavior.
- `st.chat_message(..., width="stretch")` is valid in Streamlit 1.56; `"stretch"` is
  also the default.
- `st.chat_input(..., height=68, max_upload_size=50)` is valid in Streamlit 1.56. Keep
  Python-side upload size validation as defense-in-depth.
- Prefer `st.iframe` over `streamlit.components.v1.html`/`components.html` for the
  sidebar copy button behavior.
- Do not adopt `st.container(autoscroll=True)` unless chat history is moved into a
  fixed-height container. Avoid fixed-height chat containers unless explicitly requested.

## CSS and UI Constraints
- Preserve `theme.css` `:root` custom-property architecture.
- Preserve `st-key-{role}-` message wrapper patterns for user/assistant styling.
- No external fonts, web fonts, CDNs, or externally loaded assets; keep the app
  air-gapped friendly.
- Use a system font stack and standard font weights: 400, 500, 600, 700, 800.
- CSS targeting Streamlit internals, `data-testid`, or generated DOM is brittle; add
  comments on selectors that are new/changed for Streamlit 1.56.
- Keep **New chat** and **Copy conversation** visible in the sidebar.
- `st.menu_button` is allowed only for lower-frequency sidebar actions (Help, About,
  Settings, debug/status views).
- Do not hide the sidebar with aggressive mobile CSS; let Streamlit handle responsive
  sidebar behavior.

## Qwen3.6 Defaults (Target Behavior)
- `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` is the default target model, exposed through the local Ollama alias
  `ephemeral-default`.
- Run Qwen in **non-thinking mode** by default. EphemerAl request defaults should be:
  - `reasoning_effort="none"`
  - `temperature=0.7`
  - `top_p=0.8`
  - `presence_penalty=1.5`
- The Ollama alias `Modelfile` should define:
  - `PARAMETER num_ctx 262144`
  - `PARAMETER num_predict -1`
  - `PARAMETER temperature 0.7`
  - `PARAMETER top_p 0.8`
  - `PARAMETER top_k 20`
  - `PARAMETER min_p 0`
  - `PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.0`
- Do **not** put `presence_penalty` in the Modelfile unless the installed Ollama
  version explicitly supports it. Keep `presence_penalty` request-level for EphemerAl
  and OpenAI-compatible clients.

## Context and Output Policy
- `PARAMETER num_ctx` in the alias Modelfile is the source of truth for actual Ollama
  model context.
- `LLM_CONTEXT_TOKENS` is only EphemerAl's document-budgeting hint.
- `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` is not the primary approach for this stack because Ollama may
  become a shared API backend.
- `num_predict -1` avoids an Ollama-side artificial output cap.
- EphemerAl should not send `max_tokens` unless `LLM_MAX_TOKENS` is explicitly set.
- `LLM_OUTPUT_RESERVE_TOKENS` reserves input budget for large responses; it is not an
  output cap.

## Reasoning / Thinking Policy
- Qwen3.6 thinking should be disabled via runtime/API controls, not prompt text.
- Do not add `/nothink`, `<think>`, or "think step by step" to the system prompt.
- EphemerAl should discard streamed reasoning deltas unless
  `LLM_SHOW_REASONING=true`.
- Keep think-block stripping as defense-in-depth.

## Shared API Backend Policy
- Raw Ollama should remain internal by default.
- Optional API exposure should happen via a separate `docker-compose.api.yml`
  override.
- Keep `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1` and `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1` unless capacity testing
  proves otherwise.
- Shared API users should call model `ephemeral-default`.
- External OpenAI-compatible clients should send:
  - `reasoning_effort="none"`
  - `temperature=0.7`
  - `top_p=0.8`
  - `presence_penalty=1.5`

## Review Guidelines
When reviewing Codex changes, treat the following as high-priority checks:
- privacy regressions
- accidental logging of prompts, uploaded documents, or model output
- Docker networking exposure changes
- loss of non-thinking behavior
- incorrect context/output budgeting
- broken copy-paste commands in deployment docs
- changes that regress Streamlit 1.56 UI migration compatibility

## Testing
- Verify Python syntax: `python -m py_compile ephemeral_app.py ephemeral/*.py`
- Verify requirements install: `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip check`
- Verify test tooling + run tests: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && python -m pytest`
- Verify linting: `ruff check .`
- Verify Markdown links resolve: all relative links in README.md and the deployment
  guide should point to files that exist in the repo.
- Full stack test: `docker compose up -d --build` inside WSL2, then access
  `http://localhost:8501`.
- Keep pure utility modules import-safe (`config`, `export`, `stream_filter`,
  `token_budget`): no Streamlit imports or Streamlit side effects at import time, so
  tests run without Streamlit.
- `ephemeral/tika_client.py` and `ephemeral/llm_client.py` are Streamlit-aware by
  design and may use Streamlit caching decorators/session state.
- Manual UI validation checklist:
  - empty welcome state
  - text-only chat
  - file-upload chat
  - long assistant response rendering/streaming
  - mobile viewport behavior
  - backend-unavailable state (Ollama or Tika down)

## Do Not
- Do not change environment variable defaults in `ephemeral_app.py` to use `localhost`.
  The defaults MUST remain Docker service names for container-to-container communication.
- Do not remove Docker, WSL2, or Linux content from the deployment guide or README.
  That is the supported deployment path.
- Do not modify `system_prompt_template.md` unless changing the LLM's system behavior.
- Do not add new Python dependencies beyond what's in `requirements.txt` without
  documenting the reason.
- Do not remove think-block/thought-channel filtering from `ephemeral/stream_filter.py` or from the streaming response path in `ephemeral_app.py`; it is required as defense-in-depth against leaked reasoning output.
- Do not persist prompts, uploaded files, parsed document text, or model output to disk.
- Do not log chat content, uploaded document content, or model output.

## Repository expectations

- This is a Streamlit 1.56 app.
- The package layout is flat. The `ephemeral/` package lives at the repository root.
- Pytest import resolution is configured in `pyproject.toml` with `pythonpath = ["."]`.
- Do not change `st.set_page_config(initial_sidebar_state=304)`. The integer is intentional Streamlit 1.56 behavior: auto sidebar behavior with a 304px initial sidebar width.
- Do not replace that value with `"auto"` unless the user explicitly asks for a sidebar UX change.
- Do not add production dependencies without explicit user approval.
- Prefer small, focused PRs.

## Required validation after Python changes

Run from the repository root:

1. `python -m pytest -q`
2. `pytest -q`
3. `python -m py_compile ephemeral_app.py ephemeral/*.py`
4. `ruff check .`

You may also run:

- `bash scripts/validate.sh`

## Browser/UI testing

- UI smoke testing requires the Python Playwright package **and** a Chromium browser installed in the environment.
- Playwright is a dev/test dependency only (in `requirements-dev.txt`), not a production dependency.
- Generated screenshots under `artifacts/ui-smoke/` are test artifacts and should not be committed.
- Browser smoke tests are useful for Streamlit UI and clipboard iframe behavior.
- For UI, Streamlit, `theme.css`, or clipboard changes, run:
  - `python scripts/ui_smoke.py`
  - or `bash scripts/validate_ui.sh`
- If UI smoke succeeds, report screenshot paths:
  - `artifacts/ui-smoke/home-desktop.png`
  - `artifacts/ui-smoke/home-mobile.png`
- Do not add Playwright, Selenium, Chrome, Chromium, WebKit, or browser binaries unless the user explicitly asks for browser automation in that PR.
- If browser automation/testing is unavailable in the Codex container, report that clearly as a manual smoke-test item instead of silently skipping validation or adding dependencies.
